# Easy Dynamics OSCAL Viewer

The OSCAL Viewer sample application is a React-based UI used for browsing OSCAL data. It is provided both as an
example of using OSCAL React components and as a tool to view the complex OSCAL data concepts in an easily
comprehensive format.

An open sandbox environment of the project can be viewed at
