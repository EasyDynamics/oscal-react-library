# OSCAL React Library

A library of React components that provides a direct view
into NIST's Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) data in JSON format.

Follow this project and contribute on [GitHub.](https://github.com/EasyDynamics/oscal-react-library)

## Using Storybook

This page displays [stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/whats-a-story) for each isolated
React component in the library. The components can be viewed and tested in various usage examples.
Each story will display the props passed in for a given example at the bottom of the page, where they
can be edited to test out different configurations.

For more information on using Storybook, check out their official [documentation.](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction)

## Building

Run `npm install` to install dependencies for the library.

There is also an example OSCAL viewer to see the library in action; Check out the [live demo](https://oscal-viewer.msd.easydynamics.com/catalog)
or build and run it locally with: `npm run build-library-and-run-example`.
