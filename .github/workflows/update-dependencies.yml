# This workflow needs to leverage a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) in order
# to open the pull request. While the GitHub Actions token _could_ create the
# pull request if the `permissions` block were edited to allow that, the created
# PR would not actually trigger any status checks, which would be mostly useless.
# Therefore a PAT is used. Theoretically, any of the mechanisms listed in the
# peter-evans/create-pull-request Action's README could be used (and we may
# eventually switch to using the app).
