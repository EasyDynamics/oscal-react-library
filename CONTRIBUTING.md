# Contributing

Easy Dynamics welcomes contributions to our projects in any form; new features, bug fixes,
documentation, bug and security reports, and tests are all greatly appreciated. There are a few
guidelines outlined in this document we ask you follow to make your contributions easier to
accept. Please read this document in its entirety, especially before opening a pull
request.

## Creating Issues

To report a bug or to start a conversation around a proposed change, please use the Issues feature
on the GitHub repository. When reporting a bug, please provide clear steps to reproduce the issue;
providing specific inputs and steps makes it easier to confirm and debug. If you are proposing a
change you would like to work on, please mention that in the initial message when opening the
ticket.

## Making Changes

*Note*: It is necessary to sign a contributor license agreement, CLA, prior to contributing code
to the repository; however, we have not completed the process of writing the CLA and therefore
cannot merge pull requests at this time. Please still open an Issue to discuss suggested changes
and we will identify a path forward.

When contributing a change to the code base, please first open a GitHub issue to discuss it prior
to starting work; this will help ensure your contribution aligns with the goals of the project and
also to prevent duplicate efforts on a feature or bug fix. Once the work to implement the feature
or fix is complete, the change can be submitted using the GitHub pull request process. While pull
requests may be accepted if an issue was not opened ahead of time, it will significantly reduce
the time and effort to review if the change is properly discussed first.

When contributing code, please ensure tests are added for new code as well as that there are not
any regressions in the test suite. Review the [README.md](/README.md) for information on running
the tests and linters.

### Review Process

Open a pull request and reference the issue where the change was discussed in the body of the pull
request. Once you've opened the pull request, the automated CI workflows will run linters and tests
on the code and will provide a report listing passing and failing tests. Once those checks have
run, one or more project maintainers will review your changes and may provide feedback, ask
questions, or request changes. Once any outstanding requests or questions have been resolved and
the status checks are passing, your change will be merged to the repository.

### Finding Issues

If you would like to contribute to the project but aren't quite sure where to start, we often tag
feature requests or bug reports that need someone to pick them up with the
[`help wanted` label](/../../issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). For issues
that might be especially good for new contributors, we use the
[`good first issue` label](/../../issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## License

Review the [LICENSE](/LICENSE) file for information on the project's licensing.
