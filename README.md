# Easy Dynamics OSCAL React Library

A React Library providing components and an example application, OSCAL Viewer, for browsing OSCAL data.

## Setting Up

### Intro

The library provides OSCAL community UI developers a flexible framework for using OSCAL React components outside the scope of the OSCAL Viewer and in their own applications. There are two main parts to local developoment: 1) the `src/` module which contains OSCAL components, loaders, and other library elements; and 2) the `example/` module which contains the OSCAL Viewer application. This project was created following the [create-react-library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library) model.

### Usage
A component can be created and added to `src/components`. In order for the component to be used in an application, it must either be added as an export in `src/index.js` or referenced by a component already being exported (such as components being referenced by a loader in the current OSCAL Viewer). In the root folder of the project, run `npm start` to roll up all of the components into `dist/` making them accessible to the example application. NOTE: `npm install` has the same effect and will build all dependencies.

### Running

In order to use the library components or test the library, the project components need to be rolled up and dependencies need to be installed initially with the command: `npm install`. From here the application can be built (See "OSCAL Viewer â†’ Running") or components can be tested (See "Testing"). To automate local installation and immediately run the application, use the following command:
```
npm run build-proj
```

### Testing

To run the test suite, ensure dependencies are installed and run `npm run test`. To also validate code is passing eslint linting requirements, run `npm run lint`.

## OSCAL Viewer (Example Application)

The OSCAL Viewer example application allows developers to sample the various OSCAL concepts and view their features.

### Running
Once root dependencies have been installed, the application dependencies can be built and OSCAL Viewer can be ran by issuing the following command:

```
npm run build-app
```

After application dependencies are installed, use:

```
npm run run-app
```
